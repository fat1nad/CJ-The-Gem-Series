# CJ - The Gem Series

A little AR application to browse through a made up retail product series.

## How To Run

* Download CJ - The Gem Series.apk to an android phone, install and then run the app.
* You will also need the 77mm wide QR code that the app works on. You can either use the .pdf file for an A4 paper print out, or zoom in/out of the .jpg file on your screen to make it approximately 77mm wide.
